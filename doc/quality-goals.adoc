== Primary Quality Goals

|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Stakeholder|Description

|1
|User experience (Business Expert)
a|* Business Expert
|Users who are not software developers should be able to create and edit
Executable Documents with minimal or no training. Reports are easy to
understand.

|2
|User experience (Developer)
a|* Developer
|Implementing Fixtures is straight-forward for developers and they can grasp
the basics with minimal or no training. Fixtures are readable and minimal in
size and complexity.

|3
|Cloud-Readiness
a|* Administrator
|All LD2 server components follow 12-Factor principles. LD2 integrates well
with public and private cloud environments.

|4
|Confidentiality
a|* All Users
|Use of LD2 does not compromise the confidentiality of information contained in
executable documents or any systems with which it integrates.

|5
|Fault Tolerance
a|* All Users
|LD2 is able to return to a consistent state when handling malformed
inputs (including Executable Documents and Fixtures). It degrades gracefully
in case of partial failure of its components.

|6
|Robustness to Vendor Updates
a|* Administrator
|Using LD2 should not prevent updates to components shared with other systems.
Especially patches of Atlassian Confluence should not break LD2.

|7
|Maintainability
a|* All Users
|Changes and bugfixes to LD2 can be implemented quickly.
