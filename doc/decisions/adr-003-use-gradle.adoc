= ADR 3: Use Gradle

== Context

In order to build the different components of LivingDoc 2 we need
a build tool. There are two major tools available:

- Maven
- Gradle

Maven is good for straight forward and simple projects like libraries
or micro services. But as our experience in many projects taught us,
Maven reaches its limit with more complex projects.

LivingDoc is _not_ a simple project.

== Decision

We will use Gradle.

== Status

Proposed.

== Consequences

* Every team member should learn Gradle
