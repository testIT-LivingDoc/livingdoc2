Decision Table:: [[decision-table]]
A table where each row represents a <<test-case,Test Case>>.  A column can
contain either a <<test-input,Test Input>> or an <<expectation,Expectation>>.

Example:: [[example]]
A description of the behavior of the <<system-under-test,System under
Test>>, which can be automatically verified by LivingDoc. <<scenario,Scenario>>
and <<decision-table,Decision Table>> are examples.

Executable Document:: [[executable-document]]
A document describing the <<system-under-test,System under Test>>. It contains
zero or more <<example,Examples>>.

Expectation:: [[expectation]]
A value that is passed to the <<fixture,Fixture>> to determine the outcome of a
<<test-case,Test Case>>.

Fixture:: [[fixture]]
Coded by a developer, a fixture is used to execute a <<test-case,Test Case>>.
The fixture maps <<test-input,Test Inputs>> to a series of interactions with the
<<system-under-test,System under Test>> and evaluates <<expectations,Expectations>>.

Scenario:: [[scenario]]
An <<example, Example>> describing a single <<test-case,Test Case>> as a
sequence of <<scenario-step, Steps>>.

Scenario Step:: [[scenario-step]]
A single step of a <<scenario, Scenario>> represented as a sentence containing
either one or more <<test-input,Test Inputs>> or one or more <<expectation,Expectations>>.

System under Test (SuT):: [[system-under-test]]
The system against which <<test-case,Test Cases>> are executed.

Test Case:: [[test-case]]
The smallest independently executable part of an
<<executable-document,Executable Document>>. A test case has to define one or
more <<expectation,Expectations>>. If all expectations are met, the test case
succeeds, otherwise it fails.

Test Input:: [[test-input]]
A value that is passed to the <<fixture,Fixture>> to set up an interaction
with the <<system-under-test,System under Test>>.

Type Converter:: [[type-converter]]
Referenced by a <<fixture,Fixture>>, a type converter takes
<<test-input,Test Inputs>> and maps them to types in the test domain (e.g.
converts the string `"5 â‚¬"` to `Currency(Type.EURO, 5)`).
