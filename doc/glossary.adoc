Decision Table:: [[decision-table]] A table where each line represents
a <<test-case,Test Case>>.  A column can contain either a <<test-input,Test
Input>> or an <<expectation,Expectation>>.

Example:: A description of the behavior of the <<system-under-test,System under
Test>>, which can be automatically verified by LivingDoc. <<scenario,Scenario>>
and <<decision-table,Decision Table>> are examples.

Executable Document:: [[executable-document]]A document describing the
<<system-under-test,System under Test>>. It contains zero or more
<<example,Examples>>.

Expectation:: [[expectation]]A value that is passed to the <<fixture,Fixture>>
to determine the outcome of a <<test-case,Test Case>>.

Fixture:: [[fixture]]Coded by a developer, a fixture is used by an
<<interpreter,Interpreter>> to execute a <<test-case,Test Case>>. The fixture
maps <<test-input,Test Inputs>> to a series of interactions with the
<<system-under-test,System under Test>> and evaluates
<<expectations,Expectations>>.

Interpreter:: [[interpreter]] Takes an <<example,Example>>, determines required
<<fixture,Fixtures>> and executes specified <<test-case,Test Cases>>.

Scenario:: [[scenario]]A table describing a <<test-case,Test Case>>. Each line
of the table represents an individual test step, which consists of keywords,
<<fixture-command,Fixture Commands>>, <<test-input,Test Inputs>> and
<<expectation,Expectations>>.

System under Test (SuT):: [[system-under-test]] The system against which
<<test-case,Test Cases>> are executed.

Test Case:: [[test-case]]The smallest independently executable part of an
<<executable-document,Executable Document>>. A test case has to define one or
more <<expectation,Expectations>>. If all expectations are met, the test case
succeeds, otherwise it fails.

Test Input:: [[test-input]] A value that is passed to the <<fixture,Fixture>>
to set up an interaction with the <<system-under-test,System under Test>>.

Type Converter:: Referenced by a <<fixture,Fixture>>, a type converter takes
<<test-input,Test Inputs>> and maps them to types in the test domain (e.g.
converts the string `"5 â‚¬"` to `Currency(Type.EURO, 5)`).
